# Swtich-VR

This VR game involves two players: a player inside the VR headset and a player playing on the desktop display and keyboard. There are several lamps inside the scene, and the goal of the Desktop player (the "Dark" player) is to switch off all the lamps in the scene before the time limit, while the goal of the VR player (the "Light" player) is to prevent the Desktop player from doing so before the time limit.
